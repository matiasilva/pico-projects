# Pico Projects

This is my collection of projects made with the Raspberry Pi Pico micro-controller.

## Projects

A list of projects included in this repo.

### LED panel

A controller for my LED panel with three inputs for each RGB component and accordingly, three PWM outputs. Uses the built-in ADC and the PWM block.

## Technical notes

* This repo is one big CMake project for ease of building
* Make sure you have the `PICO_SDK_PATH` environment variable set
* To use the debugger with VS Code, ensure that you have the right `launch.json` (see docs)
